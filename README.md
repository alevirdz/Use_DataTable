# Introduction

I present a working example using the datatable library.

The implementation was developed with vanilla JavaScript.

# Development

In this development, I used the tools that this wonderful library offers us and from which I was able to generate an asynchronous request using Axios for the development of this example.


Within the functions implement that you can detect the click to the element which you want to give an action.

# Actions
Within the planned actions use three basic ones: <strong>Save, Edit and Delete</strong> . (It was for example)

# Use of the library

Within the planned actions use the functionality to Generate reports and to use paging.

I was generating an array of configurations for the DataTable.

### You can review the file

```
File configuration: ConfigTable.JS
```

# Technology

# Reference
Maybe there is no nice design at the moment but I wanted to show the functionalities that we have with this library.
